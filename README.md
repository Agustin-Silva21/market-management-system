#Market Management System
###The Market Management System is a Java-based application designed to assist a market in efficiently managing its stock, sales, and product metrics. This system aims to streamline the market's operations by providing an easy-to-use interface and essential functionalities for effective stock control and sales management.

##Features
###Stock Control for Products Bought:
The system allows the market staff to input and manage the stock of products bought from suppliers. It enables the addition, modification, and removal of products from the inventory.

###Real-time Product Availability Check:
Before making a sale, the system checks the availability of the product in the inventory. If the product is out of stock or insufficient stock, it notifies the user to avoid selling unavailable items.

###Product Metrics:
The system provides simple metrics for each product sold by the market. Metrics may include:

*Total sold (in kilograms or units depending on how the product was registered)
*Total revenue generated from a specific product
*Average price the product has been bought
*Average price the product has been sold
*Stores that have sold at the highest price
*Stores that have sold at the lowest price

###User-friendly Interface:
The Market Management System offers a simple graphical user interface (GUI).
As it was my first approach the main focus was functionality rather than design.
